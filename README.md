#### Variables

**Quill** uses CSS variables to automatically generate customized style.

##### Colors

There are three important CSS variables for color to set :

- `--primary` : the primary color is used to make identifiable components
- `--secondary` : the secondary color is used to make accent components
- `--neutral` : the neutral color is used for background and foreground generic colors

There are four semantic color that can be modified for a more fined grained customization :

- `--info-color`
- `--success-color`
- `--warning-color`
- `--error-color`
